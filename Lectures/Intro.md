# FFmpeg That

Hello! I'm teaching a class. I think. If you want. It's cool if you don't. You
know what? I don't like the "class" word. Too many bad memories. How about
"season"? Yeah! I'm airing a _season_. Come for the cool episodes! I can be
entertaining, right? Right?

Anyway, the _show_ is about how to FFmpeg That. Find out how to people can do
all sorts of cool stuff, automatically! Maybe even YOU!

_But I already know how to edit video_, I hear you say. That's great! But can
you do that to 30 assets all at once, _automatically_?

Now you can! You can FFmpeg That!

- Convert from ProRes to MP4 automatically.
- Burn in subtitles or add subtitle tracks.
- Host a video on a link and share it with your friends!
- Um, there's actually... a lot. It's kinda hard to list it all. FFmpeg is
  _crazy_. Besides, I'll be listing all that stuff below.

## FFmpeg: The Ultimate Pipe Game

I'm calling my class "FFmpeg: The Ultimate Pipe Game". It's not "FFmpeg That".
That's, like, the _community_ name. The Channel Brand, if you will. I'm hoping
you guys will stick around after the class is over. Maybe _you_ can give a
brownbag too! I'd love to learn something from you!

FFmpeg isn't that hard, it's just a pipe game. You know, like this:

Except, no, it's not like all of those. Some of those are scary. But yeah,
pipes. Pretty cool. :pipe:

Each class (derp, _episode_) will cover _topics_ and _recipes_. The topics is
the boring stuff. Like, think of it as exposition. The part of the story you
have to watch for things to make sense, but not the fun part.

The _fun_ part is the recipes. That's where you'll see how to do _cool stuff_.

Here are the episodes. You know, if you want. Ooh! That reminds me! If you
want to see an episode, react to this message with the emoji next to the episode
name and I'll put you on the watch party invite!

### Episodes

#### :racing_car: Episode 1: Start Your Engines!

_Open the pipe game box and see what's inside._

 - _topics covered_:
   - Install `ffmpeg` on Mac OS X *in 5 minutes*. (If you're on a Windows
     machine, that's okay! I can go over that too!)
     (If you're on Linux, I'm sure You've Got This. :wink:)
   - Pipe Game Rules, or How FFmpeg Works.
   - Basic FFmpeg options.
 - _recipes covered_:
   - Convert variable bit rate to constant bit rate. (That means "prep a movie
     for YouTube/FaceBook/all-the-things upload".)
   - Change a .MOV file to a .MP4 file. (Also for YouTube? Or whatever?)
   - Make an MP4 file smaller without sacrificing quality!
   - Make your timestamps scrubbable per-frame. (If you don't know what this is,
     you can safely ignore it.)

#### :pipe: Episode 2: Connect the Pipes!

_Make a single pipe chain._

 - _topics covered_:
   - Using _filters_ (the "pipe parts" in the "pipe game").
   - Using MORE THAN ONE filter at once! (This is way cooler than it sounds.)
 - _recipes covered_: (Um, sorry to interrupt. This episode is hard, because pipes
   are at the _heart_ of FFmpeg. There are _tons_ of recipes I could do. So
   reply with your thoughts on which of these are the most useful to you, maybe?
   I can't actually cover _all_ of them. Gotta cut something, right? This is why
   the movie is always worse than the [book](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html).
   - Mess with a video's Brightness, Contrast, and Gamma (because it looks
     too washed out or too dark).
   - Mess with a video's colors/color correction (because color is good).
   - Burn in subtitles on to a video (so that people can mute your TikTok
     video and still see what you're saying).
   - Add subtitles into a video the _normal, boring_ way.
   - Format subtitles so they look nice. (I know, a _lot_ of screen time given
     to subtitles in this episode. Just let me know if it's too much.)
   - Change the framerate of a video from 23.976 to 24 or 25 or whatever.
   - Do any combination of these things all at the same time!

#### :pan-pipe: Episode 3: The Pan Piper

_Make more than one pipe chain._

 - _topics covered_:
   - Image filters (Convert movies to images! Get screenshots and stuff.)
   - Making more than one pipe chain at the same time.
 - _recipes covered_:
   - Create four different aspect ratios by cropping off the parts of the video
     that don't matter all at once.
   - Create sprite sheets and image mosaics of each scene change in your movie.
     Now you can make it easy to drag that little bar at the bottom of videos
     and still have your users see previews of the video!
   - Extract four different sizes (resolutions) of each frame in the movie. Now
     you can make thumbnails!

#### :funky-pipe: Episode 4: Funky Pipes

_Make *funky* pipe chains._

- _topics covered_:
  - Complex Filters (Funky P

 - _
