# :racing_car: Episode 1: Start Your Engines!

_Open the pipe game box and see what's inside._

OK, so, this episode thing. I guess we're doing a super hero story? Fantasy?
Whatever. At any rate we need to soup up your mac with Super FFmpeg Powers.

We can do this any number of ways, and your preference will matter here. So
let's do a little "Choose Your Own Adventure".

- You are a haxxor who h4z the c0d3zz: `brew install ffmpeg`, see
  https://brew.sh/ .
- You are a normal person who is hoping this will be as painless as possible:
  for that, we'll have to go to some random back alley, a joint named
  [Martin Riedl's FFmpeg Build Server](https://ffmpeg.martin-riedl.de/).
  You install the `.pkg` file for `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`, and you're good to go :)
- You are on a Fedora Linux box
  use RPMFusion to `dnf install ffmpeg`.

That's all I got. I'm certain there's an `apt-get install -y ffmpeg` somewhere
for you Ubuntu Linux folks, but I'm not on such a machine at the moment so I
wouldn't know.

Let's say you've gone through whatever adventure above suits best your fancy.

Cool.

Now FFmpeg isn't an "Application" in the normal sense. You can't find it in
"Applications" in Finder. It's more of an indy tool. Digs the underground scene.
To use it, we'll need to open up an application called "Terminal".

It's a pretty scary window, but hey, super hero shows need conflict.

Don't worry! We'll walk through everything together. That's why we're all here!

Before we run ffmpeg, we need to understand how it works.

FFmpeg is a pretty 

So the first thing we want to do 


we're doing 

 - _topics covered_:
   - Install `ffmpeg` on Mac OS X *in 5 minutes*. (If you're on a Windows
     machine, that's okay! I can go over that too!)
     (If you're on Linux, I'm sure You've Got This. :wink:)
   - Pipe Game Rules, or How FFmpeg Works.
   - Basic FFmpeg options.
 - _recipes covered_:
   - Convert variable bit rate to constant bit rate. (That means "prep a movie
     for YouTube/FaceBook/all-the-things upload".)
   - Change a .MOV file to a .MP4 file. (Also for YouTube? Or whatever?)
   - Make an MP4 file smaller without sacrificing quality!
   - Make your timestamps scrubbable per-frame. (If you don't know what this is,
     you can safely ignore it.)
